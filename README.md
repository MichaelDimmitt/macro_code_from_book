## MacroCodeFromBook

## Metaprogramming Elixir

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelDimmitt/macro_code_from_book.git
cd macro_code_from_book
dir=$(pwd)
ln -s $dir/lib/mix/tasks/all.ex $dir/all.ex
```

run all the tests:
`mix test`

run the mix task all:
`mix all`

## Predict the future:
This project has tests,
This project has a mix task named "all"

## Future stuff.
On the to-do, figure out how to get tests to IO.inspect or debug instead of making the assertion, just tell either the left side or the right side for all tests. I know it will be slower but it will be cool!
